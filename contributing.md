# Contributing to Easy ECAD Downloader

Thanks for contributing.

This repository is a compact browser extension that exports KiCad-compatible CAD assets from supported EasyEDA-backed and SamacSys-backed product pages. Keep the current scope, runtime split, and repository rules in mind when making changes.

Read `AGENTS.md` before changing code, tests, or governance docs.

## Ways to contribute

- Bug reports for broken detection, preview failures, wrong file naming, or bad export behavior
- Compatibility fixes for changed site markup on supported providers
- Focused feature work that fits the current popup, content-script, and service-worker model
- Documentation improvements for setup, troubleshooting, and supported behavior

## Useful bug report details

Include:

- the exact product page URL
- the detected part number or expected part number
- expected behavior versus actual behavior
- browser and OS version
- any relevant popup, content-script, or service-worker errors

For SamacSys-backed pages, note whether previews worked, whether ZIP export failed, and whether the upstream site required sign-in.

## Development setup

Use Node `22.13.0+` recommended, Node `20.19.0+`, or Node `24+`. Node `21.x` is not supported by the current Vitest/Vite/jsdom stack.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Load the extension unpacked in Chrome or temporarily in Firefox.
4. Run `npm run validate` before finalizing changes.

The repository includes `.nvmrc` for the recommended Node version.

## Manual extension loading

Chrome:

1. Open `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable `Developer mode`.
3. Click `Load unpacked`.
4. Select the repository root that contains `manifest.json`.

Firefox:

1. Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
2. Click `Load Temporary Add-on`.
3. Select `manifest.json` from the repository root.

The development manifest expects Firefox `121+` so Firefox can use the background-document fallback while Chrome uses the Manifest V3 service worker.

## Local validation

Run the local checks with:

```bash
npm install
npm run lint
npm test
npm run validate
```

`npm run validate` runs linting, the Vitest regression suite, a moderate-severity dependency audit, and whitespace checks. CI uses `npm ci` and the same validation script on the supported Node lines.

The Vitest suite includes a history-wide security hygiene check. It is meant for full validation, CI, security cleanup, and before sharing pushed history; it does not need to be run manually for every intermediate local commit while iterating.

Use `README.md` for the operator-facing overview. Use `systemDesign.md` for the implemented design and `docs/architecture-notes.md` for short implementation notes.

## Change guidelines

- Make small, explicit changes.
- Update tests with every substantive behavior change.
- Update docs when behavior, support boundaries, or module ownership changes.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` for user-visible changes, repository validation changes, security changes, and release-relevant fixes.
- Do not refactor production files unless behavior or repository rules require it.
- Keep browser API orchestration in the worker, DOM extraction in the content script, and UI state in the popup.
- Use the established naming styles: lower snake_case for JavaScript files, lower kebab-case for docs and image assets, and lower camelCase for function declarations.
- Split maintained JavaScript before it grows past the repository line-count limits enforced by the hygiene suite.

## Pull requests

- Run `npm run validate` before opening or updating a pull request.
- Summarize the user-visible or repository-level impact clearly.
- Call out manual verification, assumptions, and remaining risks.

## Security

Do not commit secrets, browser-profile data, or private keys. Read `SECURITY.md` before reporting credential, permission, relay, or auth-forwarding issues, and report security-sensitive issues privately.
